# tank_level_detect

<p> 
When discussing level-sensing technologies, itâ€™s important to make the distinction between continuous and point level sensors. Point level sensors only output a signal when the fill level passes a certain predefined threshold. This makes them valuable for underfill or overfill alerts, for example, but only continuous tank level sensors can provide up-to-date quantified level measurements. For this reason, continuous tank level sensors are the preferred technology for accurate stock monitoring, management and forecasting.

ultrasonic sensors, measure the time taken for a pulse of high-frequency sound to reflect off the surface of stored media. Continuous tank level sensors based on ultrasound are non-invasive and have low power requirements;
